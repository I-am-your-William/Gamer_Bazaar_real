ðŸŽ“ Advanced Interview-Style Questions Based on Your GamerBazaar Project
ðŸ”· Architecture & Design
Explain your full-stack architecture. How does data flow from the React component to the database and back? Include any middle layers or abstractions you implemented.

Why did you separate your frontend and backend into distinct folders rather than a monorepo or integrated structure?

What trade-offs did you consider when choosing Drizzle ORM over Prisma or raw SQL?

If you had to containerize this project for production (e.g., Docker), how would you structure the Dockerfiles and multi-container setup?

Describe how you would scale this application horizontally. What services or design changes would be necessary to support thousands of concurrent users?

How would you implement microservices architecture if GamerBazaar had separate modules (auth, cart, product, etc.)?

How did you handle cross-origin communication between your Vite (React) frontend and Express backend during development and deployment?

Given Viteâ€™s hot module reload and ESM-based dev server, what impact does that have on bundling, tree-shaking, and cold-start performance compared to Webpack?

How do you handle SSR or SEO concerns with your React frontend? If you had to make it crawlable by search engines, what changes would be required?

ðŸ”· React (Frontend) - Advanced
Why did you use Tailwind CSS over a CSS-in-JS library like Emotion or Styled Components? What are the long-term maintainability concerns of utility-first CSS?

Your frontend is written in TypeScript. How did you enforce strict typing across props and API responses to reduce runtime errors?

Explain how you would implement code-splitting in Vite and React. How does it affect performance and user experience?

What are the advantages of using useReducer over useState in complex forms or shopping carts? Did you use either, and why?

How would you persist cart state across page reloads, and how would you secure it against tampering if stored in localStorage?

If you were to integrate client-side error logging (e.g., Sentry), where and how would you implement it?

How would you integrate server-sent events (SSE) or WebSockets in your React app to support real-time inventory or chat?

ðŸ”· Express & API - Advanced
How do you structure and modularize your Express routes to support clean separation of concerns and scalability?

What are middleware functions in Express, and how did you implement or customize them (e.g., auth, logging, rate-limiting)?

Whatâ€™s the difference between global and route-level error handling in Express, and how did you apply both?

In a real production environment, how would you implement input validation and sanitation securely for each endpoint?

What rate-limiting strategies would you apply to your API routes to prevent abuse, and how would it integrate with Express?

How do you ensure idempotency of critical endpoints such as payment, cart updates, or order confirmation?

How did you handle transaction safety and atomic operations in PostgreSQL (e.g., multiple related inserts)?

ðŸ”· PostgreSQL (NeonDB) + Drizzle
What isolation level does PostgreSQL use by default? How would you modify it if you experienced deadlocks under concurrent writes?

Drizzle ORM supports SQL-like syntax in TypeScript. What benefits does this provide compared to runtime ORMs like Sequelize?

How do you handle connection pooling with NeonDB in Replit, especially since the environment sleeps and restarts?

If your app starts returning "too many connections" from NeonDB, how would you debug and resolve it?

If your product schema needs to support variants (like color or size), how would you redesign your schema using normalization or JSONB?

How would you optimize complex queries (e.g., filtering by category, price range, stock) using indexes in PostgreSQL?

Can you explain how database migrations work in Drizzle and how you ensure consistency across environments?

ðŸ”· Authentication & Security
Describe how you would implement secure session-based authentication in Replitâ€™s stateless environment.

JWTs are stateless. How do you securely store them in a browser? What risks are associated with each method (cookie vs. localStorage)?

What cryptographic functions and libraries do you use to hash passwords securely? Why not use MD5 or SHA-1?

How do you prevent CSRF in your React + Express setup?

Describe a realistic XSS attack on your appâ€™s search or product page and how you'd mitigate it.

What Content Security Policy (CSP) headers would you configure for a secure deployment of your frontend and backend?

ðŸ”· DevOps, CI/CD, Hosting
Explain how Replit handles project environments and deployments. What are its limitations compared to platforms like Render or Vercel?

If you deployed the backend on Render and frontend on Vercel, what configuration would be required to ensure cross-origin API requests work properly?

What are the risks of storing .env secrets in the frontend accidentally, and how can CI pipelines prevent this?

How would you automate database backup and restore processes using NeonDBâ€™s capabilities?

What monitoring tools or logging platforms would you integrate into this project in a real-world setup (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)?

ðŸ”· Testing & Quality Assurance
How would you test your React components (unit tests vs. integration tests)? What tools would you use (e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library)?

How would you write automated API tests for Express routes using tools like Supertest or Postmanâ€™s CLI?

What kind of end-to-end testing framework would you integrate (e.g., Cypress, Playwright) and why?

How would you mock your database in tests to isolate the logic from external systems?

Whatâ€™s your strategy for regression testing when new features are added?

ðŸ”· Project Planning & Improvements
If you had more time, how would you refactor your codebase to improve separation of concerns or scalability?

What technical debt exists in your current project and how would you prioritize resolving it?

What feature or improvement would you add to GamerBazaar if you had 1 month more â€” and how would you architect it?

Explain how you would internationalize the app (i18n), and how it would affect routing, state, and UI components.

ðŸ§  Bonus Thinking Questions
How would you make your e-commerce app offline-first with data sync when the user reconnects?

How would you detect and handle fraud or bot abuse in your system at the application level?

What are your thoughts on switching this app to Next.js + Prisma + Supabase? What would be gained or lost?

If asked to migrate your app from PostgreSQL to MongoDB, what key changes would be required â€” and which use cases might benefit?

What are the ethical implications of collecting user behavior analytics, and how should consent be managed programmatically?
